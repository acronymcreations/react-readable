# Readable Project

Readable is an anonymous blog site that allows anyone to post to, comment on, vote on, edit, or delete posts.  All interactions are anonymous.

## Quickstart

1. Clone this project to your local machine with the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/acronymcreations/react-readable.git`

2. Move into the API project directory (`cd react-readable/api-server`) and install the required
  packages with `npm install`

3. Then start the API server with `node start`.

4. Next, navigate to the frontend with `cd ../frontend` and install all required packages with `npm install`

5. Last, start the react server by running `npm start`.  The project should automatically
  launch at <http://localhost:3000/>

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
